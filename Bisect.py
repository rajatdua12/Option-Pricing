In this problem, Bisect.py, I have defined 2 functions newton and bisect which are iterative methods to find the roots of the given function. For newton method, I have provided a security wherein if the start value is zero, then it will ask the user to enter the value of lower bound and upper bound. The iteration process will then start from the mid-point of upper and lower bound. In addition, if the average causes the derivative function to come out to be zero, I have incorporated another security wherein it will add some small random uniform variable between 0 and 0.01 to the derivative function in order to begin the iteration process. I have defined a list, xval, which captures all the values of iterative roots until the function root is captured, or the value of x comes within acceptable tolerance limit, defined by the tolerance input variable. Fdiff captures list of difference between each function output of each newton iteration and target value (generally, zero) until the function comes with in given tolerance input level.
For bisect method, I have provided security that if start value is None, then the function will start iteration from the mid-point of upper and lower bound.
